# LiveKit Multi Prompt Voice Agent

## Features
- Multi-customer support: Each customer can have unique agent flows, prompts, and routing.
- Dynamic agent creation: Agents and their transitions are defined in config files, not hardcoded.
- Voice interaction: Integrates with LiveKit, OpenAI, Deepgram, and Silero for LLM, STT, TTS, and VAD.
- Extensible: Add new customers, agents, or prompts by editing config files.
- Schema validation: Ensures configs are valid using JSON Schema.

3. **Select a Customer**
    You will be prompted to pick one from the list in agents_config.json.


## ðŸ”§ Extending this project
You can extend this system by:

- Adding more customers in agents_config.json.
- Adding new function tool definitions and modifying dynamic_agent.py to support dynamic tool addition.

## Thought Process
- In the Retell Ai's Multi prompt Agent we can create Nodes with unique instructions and do conditional Routing.
- Here in this appraoch I have tried to achieve the same, We can define multiple agents, each with unique id, each agent is called on specific conditions `"conditions": { "onIntent": "report_issue" }` 
- One of the major parts of the Multi Prompt Agent is that Different Customers can have different configurations, this approach follows all those principles, *still there is alot of room for improvement :)*.
